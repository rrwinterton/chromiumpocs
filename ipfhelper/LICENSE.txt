  9.2 Dispute Resolution. If we have a dispute regarding this Agreement (other than a dispute over misappropriation of trade secrets or breaches of confidentiality obligations) neither of us can file a lawsuit or other regulatory proceeding unless the complaining party provides the other party a detailed notice of the dispute and our senior managers attempt to resolve the dispute. If we can’t resolve the dispute in 30 days, either of us may demand mediation and will then try to resolve the dispute with an impartial mediator. If we don’t resolve the dispute within 60 days after the mediation demand, either of us may begin litigation.

  9.6 Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless in a writing signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party that specifies the waived provision. That signed waiver will not constitute a waiver of any other provision. A party’s failure or delay in enforcing any provision will not operate as a waiver.
